************National Grid VALUES***********
- If the vision sets out 'what' National Grid wants to achieve, their VALUES are the 'HOW.'
- They shape the spirit, attitude and what guides them, underpinning everything they do.
- They inform our decisions, how we show up and the way we treat each other. They shape the company and how their customers and communities experience us. It allows National Grid to show their very best.
   1. DO THE RIGHT THING
 	- Stand up for safety every day
	- Put our customers first
	- Be inclusive, supporting and caring for each other
	- Speak up, challenge and act where something doesn't feel right
	- (Maybe for this, MENTION how I ask our traders on a daily basis about certain details of their monthly trades, daily trades, financial trades don't seem to match what the counterparty sends us in their trade confirmations. recently I was looking at a monthly trade that Mark did, and the delivery point was TGP, Texas Z0, Tenn, but our database system, Allegro, listed Tenn Z0 leg 100, or something like that. The fact that the counterparty had Texas in the delivery point but our system did not didn't feel right with me, so I checked Mark just to be sure. It turned out that those are the same, but I felt that it could've been an issue had I not challenged the location of the trade.)
	- (ALSO, maybe MENTION how this also happens with indices reporting on a daily basis. One time I checked with Vicki about a difference between the allegro trade and the trade in the transaction ticket for market area (Honeoye vs Niagara) and it was good I did, b/c allegro was wrong in this case but the ticket was correct. If i hadn't asked, we would've reported the wrong thing to publications and it would require a correction to that indices report, which is something that we want to avoid if possible.
	- both these examples are focus on SPEAKING UP, CHALLENGING AND ACTING WHEN SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
	- CAN ALSO MENTION: in my role as Affirmative action data analyst at Jackson Lewis, I had one client that had an active OFFCP audit for their affirmative action plans. During the reconciliation process of their employment activity records, there was a discrepancy between their promotions data and their current workforce data where some employees were promoted during the year but their title on their updated workforce snapshot was their old title. This could have led to non-compliance with OFCCP regulations if not addressed with the attorneys and client team. Rather than ignoring the issue to meet OFCCP tight deadlines, I notified my associate attorney that I work with on the project internally to decide a course of action with the client in order to reconcile this data. It required additional time and effort but it ensured that the client's affirmative action plans were aligned with federal requirements. Even though it was a tough decision due to the pressure of meeting strict deadlines, doing the right thing here protected the client from potential fines from OFCCP audit findings.


   2. FIND A BETTER WAY
	- Embrace the power and opportunity of diversity
	- Increase efficiency to help w/ customer affordability
	- Work w/ others to find solutions for customers
	- Commit to learning and new ideas
	- (Maybe for this, MENTION how I am taking data visualization to better show non-data people visuals and graphs/dashboards with much more meaning and interactive than normal. also how I am taking Risk Measures for Finance and Data Analysis to better apply and implement my knowledge of machine learning and data science to Finance applications to improve efficiency in our processes. this is a focus on commitment to learning and increasing efficiency)
	- CAN ALSO MENTION: During my time at Jackson Lewis, I had a client that always sent us data that was very messy. By messy, I mean they would send me around 25 or 26 different excel workbooks that detailed the workforce and employement activity of their 26 locations across the US that had more than 50 employees. The issue was that I had to manually combine all 26 of these workbooks into one compiled reports workbook that contained all the locations. I found a better way by using Power BI to automatically add the data from each of the workbooks (that had the same tab name, such as new hires, promos, etc). This could only be done since the formatting of each of their excel files were the same, so same number of tabs, same name of the tabs, same ordering of tabs, same number of columns in each, etc). This made the process significantly faster than manually copy and pasting the data from each of the workbooks into one spreadsheet.

   3. MAKE IT HAPPEN
	- Take personal ownership for delivering results
	- Be bold and act w/ passion and purpose
	- Focus on progress over perfection
	- Follow the problem through to the end
	- (Maybe for this, MENTION the AMS 560 cloud computing and how we didn't achieve significant improvement in the optimizing schedulers for AI/ML workloads, but there was some improvement, albeit small in certain tasks. this is a focus on progress over perfection)
	- CAN ALSO MENTION: When I was assigned to do counterparty creditworthiness assessment, where for some of the counterparties, there was very little data online to go off of, especially when the company was private or not rated. I made it happen by looking through the counterparties website to see if there were any financials I could look at, and used many platforms like the credit risk monitor, Moody's and S&P global to do as much research as possible into evaluating the creditworthiness.

Technical Questions

1. explain how SOX compliance impacts energy procurement risk management.
	A: SOX compliance directly impacts energy procurement risk management by ensuring financial reporting and operational processes associated w/ energy transactions are accurate, reliable, well-controlled. Important b/c energy procurement often requires high-value transactions and complex derivatives, which can lead to significant financial and reputational risks if mismanaged. So need to have robust internal controls, risk mitigation, and audit preparedness by having necessary documentation of changes to trade details.

2. how would you monitor trading errors in a system and address them?
	A: Addressing trading errors in system involves implementing a systematic approach to identify and correct discrepancies in trades. I would use Allegro to check trades and their corresponding details in real-time, and check the automated alerts for anomalies like unconfirmed trades or late trade entries. Then I would reconcile the daily transaction ticket with Allegro entries to ensure accuracy of the trade details. If there was an error that a trader had to fix, then I would log the change in the error tracking spreadsheet, and categorize the errors by trader error or system operational issue to better support the trader's self-audit process. I would also advise my manager of any glaring issues that might require internal controls to be updated, and system validations like input checks or mandatory fields.

3. How do Dodd-frank regs affect energy trading and risk management?
	A: Dodd-frank regulates derivative trading to promote transparency and reduce systemic risk. Key effects are: 1. recordkeeping and reporting - companies need to report trade data to repositories like ICE trade vault, to ensure transparency. 2. Clearing requirements - many derivatives must go through central clearinghouses to reduce c/p risk. 3. monitoring risk - compliance involves monitoring positions and ensuring they are w/in reg limits

4. What steps would you take to ensure accuracy in financial reporting for energy trades?
	A: ensuring accuracy in financial reporting involves internal controls, system checks and detailed processes: First data validation to verify the trade data entered into Allegro matches original contracts or trade tickets. Then reconciliation to verify Allegro records align with financial ledgers and broker confirms. Additionally, I would maintain a clear audit trail of all transactions, including trade unlocks and any changes made to key details of the trade. And I would make sure to be checking for compliance with SOX, Dodd-frank and other regulatory requirements to ensure report accuracy.

5. How would you handle issue where c/p defaults on trade?
	A: I would evaluate the impact first - to assess financial and operational impact of default, including exposure to market price movements. Then refer to the contractual agreements like the ISDAs or NAESBs and confirm with legal team the recourse and obligations. I would also notify relevant teams like EPRM, legal, finance and provide a detailed report of the issue. Then I would suggest updates to current risk policies to mitigate future defaults, like tightening credit requirements for c/p's

6. How would you assess and monitor c/p credit risk?
	A: I would perform credit reviews, similar to what I did over the summer where I analyzed companies financial statements, found their credit ratings to evaluate the counterparty's financial health. Then I would make sure the credit exposure limits are updated based on credit review, and regularly margin to ensure sufficient collateral is in place. I would also make sure the credit exposures are not too far off from the counterparty's calculation and if it is, notify the quantitative finance team of the issue to see if it can be tuned.

7. How do renewable energy credits (RECs) factor into energy risk management?
	- Renewable energy credits are tradable certificates representing proof that 1 MWh of electricity was generated from a renewable energy source. 
	A: they factor in by ensuring organization meets renewable energy mandates and regulatory requirements, managing risks related to price fluctuation and supply shortages in REC markets, better portfolio management by having broader energy procurement strategy to balance costs, risks and compliance, and having a process to confirm the REC trades to ensure contract compliance.

8. How would you approach creating a risk management framework for energy procurement?
	A: I'd make sure it identifies key risks, such as market price volatility, counterparty risk, regulatory compliance, and operational risks. I would also make sure policies and procedures are defined for these risks, like trade limits, trade approvals, and monitoring mechanisms. Then I would do system implementation where I would use a tool like Allegro for trade management, establish processes for daily monitoring of exposures and regularly review the framework to ensure it aligns with company goals and best practices.

9. How do you use Allegro system in this role?
	A: Use it for trade management(...), risk monitoring (track exposures), trade confirmations, and audit support(adding documentation to changes to long term or monthly baseload trades)

10. Can you explain role of energy indices reporting in risk manangement?
	A: Yes, it involves tracking and reporting market indices, such as natural gas prices, to monitor market trends and price exposures. It is critical for 1. valuation - by ensuring accurate valuation of energy contracts based on market benchmarks, 2. hedging - by identifying opportunities for hedging against price volatility using derivatives, 3. meeting regulatory report requirements for price transparency, and 4. providing traders and risk managers w/ reliable data to inform procurement strategies

Behavioral Questions and Questions for interviewers

1. Tell me about time you had to manage competing priorities. How did you handle it?
	A: While working at my previous job, I often had to juggle multiple different deadlines for affirmative action plans to be done within the goal deadline of 2 months. This can't be guaranteed with every client since some have very large operations in the United States with hundreds of locations to prepare plans for. There were a few instances where two big clients had overlapping deadlines, and both required a large amount of data cleaning and review. To address this, I worked with my internal client team of associate and principal attorneys to work out which project should have a higher priority. If one project was deemed more urgent by the attorneys, I would communicate with the client of the other project to manage their expectations and ensure a transparent timeline of the project. Sometimes, by the attorneys request, I would also make a timeline of the whole affirmative action plan preparation process with specific dates, and would update this document for the client if tasks had to be moved around.

2. Describe a situation where you identified and addressed a problem in your work.
	A: One case that happened a while back, was that I noticed that our calculation of the credit exposure between Citigroup and NIMO was off by a few million when comparing it to Citigroup's exposure. In order to make sure our calculations were still accurate, I notified Alex and Sean about this to allow them to investigate further, and then Sean made an inquiry to Citi, to which I believe Citi made some adjustments to their calculation. This improved the accuracy of our credit exposure by reducing the amount of variance between Citi's exposure and our exposure. 

3. Can you share an example of a time you worked with a difficult client/stakeholder? How did you manage the situation?
	A: While at the law firm, I had one client whose employment data was consistently incomplete every plan year, specifically in their race and gender data, and they were resistant to making corrections despite regulatory requirements. Each time I find this issue in their data, I ask my associate attorney who is assigned to this client how we should communicate with the client about this. And since they have tried and tried with this client to get them to send race and gender data with their reports with little success, we managed the situation by imputing missing race and gender data from the data that was there. This was done by calculating the ratios between the race and gender information per job group that was in the data.

4. Tell me about a time you had to explain a complex concept to someone w/o technical background
	A: As a data analyst, I often had to explain statistical findings to HR professionals and legal teams who did not have experience analyzing data. For one of my clients, I had to present the results of an adverse impact analysis that was done for hiring, promotions, and terminations of the company. In order to present the findings well, I used visual aids like pie charts and graphs, and avoiding technical words in my explanation. For example, instead of detailing calculations, I explained how the findings highlighted potential areas of concern for the company and what things they could do to improve them. This helped them in their implementation of recommended changes that I and the attorneys made for their situation.

5. Give an example of a time you improved a process in your workplace
	A: After around a year of working at the law firm, I made an Excel macro that would do the main parts of data intake that we had been doing manually for a while, which would check all of the 6 reports and assign numerical values to races and format gender and employee ID information. This could only be ran if all the reports were formatted properly, so it did take some initial setup before running the macro, but it definitely improved how long the data intake process would take if done manually.

6. Have you ever had to adapt quickly to a major change at work? How did you handle it?
	A: one major change I had to adapt to early in my internship here was adhering to SOX internal controls by keeping a log of any unapproved or unconfirmed trades. This was a new concept to me and I wasn't sure of all the reasons that trades show up in these automated emails, but once I got used to asking the traders about the issue, it became easier over time.
